# SQL_Injection_Detection
# Introduction
The project aims at detection of SQL injection attacks using ensemble machine learning method. Our model combines the learning of KNN, Logistic regression, And gaussian naive baiyes.
We compare the model with existing Gradient boost ensemble algorithm
# How to run
Simply run the notebook present after cloning or downloading the code.
